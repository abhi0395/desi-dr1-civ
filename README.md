DESI DR1 CIV Absorber Catalog
=============================

Catalog of **triply ionized carbon (CIV)** absorbers based on DESI DR1 Quasars. This repo also includes the catalog file for **DESI DR1 Quasars** that were searched for CIV absorbers. 

## Data & Documentation
-------------

The FITS files containing the **C IV absorbers** and the **parent quasar sample** are stored in the `data/` folder. For details on the structure and contents of the **C IV absorber catalog** and the **quasar catalog searched for absorbers**, please refer to [`data/README.md`](data/README.md).

Notebook
--------

Two [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/abhi0395/desi-dr1-civ/blob/main/notebooks/) are also provided with basic functions to explore the **C IV absorber** and **parent QSO** catalogs.
