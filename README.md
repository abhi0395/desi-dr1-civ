DESI DR1 CIV Absorber Catalog
=============================

Catalog of **triply ionized carbon (CIV)** absorbers based on DESI DR1 Quasars. This repo also includes the catalog file for **DESI DR1 Quasars** that were searched for CIV absorbers. 

Documentation
-------------

Please read `data/CIV_cat_README.md` for the details on the CIV absorber catalog, and `data/qso_cat_README.md` for details on parent quasar catalog. 

Notebook
--------

A [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/abhi0395/desi-dr1-civ/blob/main/notebooks/catalog_analysis.ipynb) is also provided with some basic functions to explore the catalog.
